#Battleships

Developed a Java-based implementation of the classic Battleships game as part of my coursework. The project involved:
- Designing a 10x10 grid to place five types of ships with varying sizes and point values.
- Implementing algorithms for random ship placement, ensuring no overlap and abiding by grid boundaries.
- Developing a user interface to allow players to choose grid squares to 'shoot' at, with real-time feedback on hits or misses.
- Adding a 'Debug Mode' to reveal the locations of ships during gameplay, aiding in the development and testing process.
- Implementing features to prevent users from selecting the same square more than once.
Through this project, I honed my skills in Java programming, algorithmic thinking, and design while gaining a deeper understanding of game development.Developed a Java-based implementation of the classic Battleships game as part of my coursework.
